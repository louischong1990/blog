The research utilises data from surveys conducted in January 2021. The data is from Imperial College London YouGov Covid 19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub and is hosted at Github. Figure 1 shows two data visualisations created by one of the research scientists of the research.\r\nFigure 1: Original Data VisualisationClarity\r\n[C.1] The data visualisation is titled “Which country is more pro-vacinne” and “% of strongly agreed to vaccination”. However, this does not accurately represent the survey question shown by the data visualisation, which is “If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it”. Furthermore, there are other questions that show whether a country is pro-vaccine e.g. whether they are worried about side effects, whether they will regret not getting the vaccine, etc.\r\n[C.2] The research team uses a general term “pro-vacinne”. Although they went on to show a data visualisation on “% of strongly agreed to vaccination”, it leaves readers guessing whether “pro-vacinne” means strongly agree and/or agree. The title could have been more specific to make it clear to readers what survey response is represented by the data visualisation.\r\n[C.3] There is no lead-in paragraph in the data visualisation to show the key message. Readers may only pick up that a higher percentage of survey respondents in the United Kingdom “strongly agreed to vaccination”, but cannot compare it with the average percentage for all countries surveyed. Furthermore, the data visualisation does not give the total number of survey respondents from the countries. As such, readers cannot find out the exact number of survey respondents that provided certain response to a specific survey question.\r\n[C.4] The demographics of survey respondents are not shown in the data visualisations. As such, readers are not able to compare and understand the sentiments of survey respondents of different demographics e.g. male vs female.\r\n[C.5] The data source is not cited in the data visualisation. This is not ideal, as readers will not be able to find out more about the background and details of the data source.\r\n[C.6] The number of survey respondents from each country is different i.e. different sample sizes. Thus, it’s unfair to compare and inappropriate to display the survey response percentage in a bar chart. Different levels of error or confidence levels should be catered for.\r\nAesthetics\r\n[A.1] The use of the 100% stacked bar chart makes it visually difficult to compare the percentage for each survey response e.g. strongly agree, agree, etc. Instead of using diverging colours to represent the likert scale, it uses 5 different colours, which can be distracting and may not be intuitive to readers that it’s a likert scale. Furthermore, 2, 3 and 4 are not labelled, so readers may not instantly know that they represent “Agree”, “Neutral” and “Disagree”.\r\n[A.2] The 100% stacked bar chart is sorted in alphabetical order, while the other bar chart is sorted in descending order by percentage that strongly agreed. This makes it hard for readers to compare both charts and find out the overall survey response for a specific country that have the highest percentage for “strongly agreed” i.e. United Kingdom.\r\n[A.3] The use of different number of decimal places in both charts is inconsistent. The 100% stacked bar chart uses 0 decimal place, while the other bar chart uses 1 decimal place. This is generally not a good practice for charts that are compared and directly relate to each other.\r\n[A.4] The data visualisation indicates “Vac 1”. However, it’s not clear to readers what the survey question is, unless they refer to the data source, which is not indicated as well.\r\nSketch of Proposed Design\r\nFigure 2 shows the sketch of the proposed data visualisation to replace the one done by the research team. It will address the critiques which were mentioned earlier.\r\nFigure 2: Sketch of Proposed Design[C.1] A filter is shown such that readers can choose the survey question. The survey question will be reflected in the title and all data visualisations or charts will change whenever the reader selects a different survey question.\r\n[C.2] Specific terms are used e.g. strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree and strongly disagree to make the chosen survey response clear to readers. Readers can also choose the survey response to look at and the title, dot plot and bar chart (breakdown of survey respondents) will change accordingly.\r\n[C.3] The title or lead-in paragraph can be changed by readers according to the chosen Survey Question, Survey Response and filters. It will give readers an overview on the overall survey response percentage and number of survey respondents for the selected survey question. Each data visualisation or chart will also show the number of survey respondents under each point or bar using Tooltip.\r\n[C.4] Readers can use the bar chart (breakdown of survey respondents) to compare and understand the sentiments of survey respondents of different demographics. In addition, they can filter based on each demographic to analyse and compare how the various data visualisations change.\r\n[C.5] The data source will be labelled at the bottom of the data visualisation or dashboard.\r\n[C.6] A parameter is created such that readers can change the confidence interval. This allows a better comparison of survey responses from countries with different sample sizes. The error bars on the dot plot will change when a different confidence interval is chosen.\r\n[A.1] A diverging stacked bar chart is used to represent the survey response (likert scale) instead. Diverging colours are used i.e. dark blue for strongly agree to dark red for strongly disagree. Each survey response is labelled appropriately for clarity to readers.\r\n[A.2] Parameters are created to allow readers to sort both the dot plot and diverging stacked bar chart at the same time. This allows better comparison of the survey responses from each country.\r\n[A.3] All the data visualisations or charts, titles and tooltips are standardised to show percentage in 0 decimal place.\r\n[A.4] The survey questions are properly named for clarity to readers.\r\n2.0 Step-by-Step Description of Data Visualisation Preparation\r\nData Preparation\r\nThe survey data from Imperial College London YouGov Covid 19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub, hosted at Github, is downloaded by running Git Clone on RStudio ($ git clone https://github.com/YouGov-Data/covid-19-tracker).\r\nData files containing responses to the 6 surveys (vac_1, vac2_1, vac2_2, vac2_3, vac2_6, vac_3) and the attributes (gender, age, household_size, household_children, employment_status) are used. This include data from Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom. The relevant columns are extracted via Excel.\r\nEach country’s data file is filtered on Excel and only rows containing responses to the 6 surveys are extracted (Figure 3).\r\nFigure 3: Rows with Survey ResponsesFor Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, the responses to employment status are separated into many columns. IF formula is used on Excel to collate the survey respondent’s employment status in a single column and rename to the respective employment status (Full time employment, Part time employment, Full time student, Retired, Unemployed, Not working, Others) (Figure 4).\r\nFigure 4: Columns with Employment StatusUnder the columns with the survey responses, “1 - Strongly agree” and “5 - Strongly disagree” are renamed to “1” and “5” respectively to allow the diverging stacked bar chart to be built subsequently.\r\nUnder the column with household size, “8” is renamed to “8 or more”.\r\nUnder the column with household children, “5”, “6”, “7” and “8” are renamed to “5 or more” and “Don’t know” to “Prefer not to say”.\r\nThe various countries’ data files are merged in Excel and a column is added to indicate the Country. The final dataset is saved as cleaned.xlsx. A sample of final dataset is seen in Figure 5.\r\nFigure 5: Final DatasetImport into Tableau\r\nThe cleaned.xlsx is imported into Tableau (Figure 6).\r\nFigure 6: Import into Tableau TypeThe data types of Record No, Household Size and Household Children are changed to String (Figure 7).\r\nFigure 7: Change of Data TypeThe vac_1, vac2_1, vac2_2, vac2_3, vac2_6 and vac_3 columns are renamed to the respective survey questions (Figure 8). The columns are clicked and pivoted (Figure 9). This will form two columns, one for Survey Question and another for Survey Response. The two columns are renamed accordingly. Figure 10 shows the data table used for subsequent data visualisations.\r\nFigure 8: Rename Survey QuestionsFigure 9: Pivot ColumnsFigure 10: Data TableMoving on to the Worksheet, the Age, Country, Employment Status, Gender, Household Children, Household Size, Survey Question and Survey Response should be under Dimensions (Figure 11).\r\nFigure 11: DimensionsNext, we right click Survey Response to edit the aliases to the respective Survey Response (Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree) to be clear to readers, as seen in Figure 12.\r\nFigure 12: Aliases for Survey ResponseDiverging Stacked Bar Chart\r\nFirst, we created calculated fields by following the step shown in Figure 13. The following calculated fields are created:\r\nNumber of Records: 1\r\nTotal Count: TOTAL(SUM([Number of Records]))\r\nCount Negative: IF [Survey Response]>3 THEN 1 ELSEIF [Survey Response]=3 THEN 0.5 ELSE 0 END\r\nTotal Count Negative : TOTAL(SUM([Count Negative]))\r\nPercentage: SUM([Number of Records])/[Total Count]\r\nGantt Start: -[Total Count Negative]/[Total Count]\r\nGantt Percent: PREVIOUS_VALUE([Gantt Start])+ZN(LOOKUP([Percentage],-1))\r\n\r\nFigure 13: Create Calculated FieldNext, Survey Response is placed under Detail and Color, Gantt Percent under Columns (Compute Using Survey Response) and Country under Rows. This is shown in Figure 14.\r\nFigure 14: Diverging Stacked Bar Chart Part 1The data visualisation or chart is changed to Gantt Bar (Figure 15).\r\nFigure 15: Diverging Stacked Bar Chart Part 2Percentage is then placed under Size, computed using Survey Response. The colours for Survey Response are edited to diverging colours. This is shown in Figure 16.\r\nFigure 16: Diverging Stacked Bar Chart Part 3As it’s a good practice for negative (strongly disagree and disagree) survey responses to be on the left and positive (strongly agree and agree) survey responses to be on the right, Survey Response is manually sorted, as seen in Figure 17.\r\nFigure 17: Diverging Stacked Bar Chart Part 4We will standardise the axis labels for Percentage to 0 decimal place, with 0.1 tick interval. We will right click to edit axis and format, as shown in Figure 18.\r\nFigure 18: Diverging Stacked Bar Chart Part 5To allow readers to select the survey question, Survey Question is placed under Filters. We will right click to Show Filter and the filter will appear on the right of the worksheet. The filter is changed to Single Value (dropdown) and customised to not show “All” value, as it’s not useful to show the response to all surveys together. This is shown in Figure 19.\r\nFigure 19: Diverging Stacked Bar Chart Part 6Next, we will place Number of Records under Detail to show the number of survey respondents and edit Tooltip, as seen in Figure 20. Percentage is formatted to 0 decimal place (as explained in Figure 18).\r\nFigure 20: Diverging Stacked Bar Chart Part 7The title is also edited, as seen in Figure 21, for clarity to readers. Finally the worksheet is adjusted to Fit Height (Figure 22). The header for x axis (Gantt Percent) and field label for row (Country) are hidden to save space and because they should be easily understood by readers (Figure 23).\r\nFigure 21: Diverging Stacked Bar Chart Part 8Figure 22: Diverging Stacked Bar Chart Part 9Figure 23: Diverging Stacked Bar Chart Part 10Figure 24 shows the diverging stacked bar chart.\r\nFigure 24: Diverging Stacked Bar Chart (Final)Dot Plot with Error Bars\r\nNext, we will create a dot plot with error bars to compare survey responses from different countries of different sample sizes. Normal distribution is assumed. We will right click Create Parameter to create a parameter for Confidence Interval. If we right click to Show Parameter, readers are able to choose the confidence interval to show for the dot plot. This is shown in Figure 25.\r\nFigure 25: Dot Plot Part 1We will also create the following calculated fields (as explained in Figure 13):\r\nZ: IF [Confidence Interval]=“95%” THEN 1.959964 ELSEIF [Confidence Interval]=“99%” THEN 2.575829 END\r\nMargin: [Z] * SQRT(([Percentage] * (1-[Percentage]))/[Total Count])\r\nUpper Limit: [Percentage]+[Margin]\r\nLower Limit: [Percentage]-[Margin]\r\n\r\nCountry is placed under Rows, Survey Response under Detail and Percentage under Columns (Compute Using Survey Response), as seen in Figure 26.\r\nFigure 26: Dot Plot Part 2The following calculated field is also created to ensure that the Survey Response can be filtered without changing the percentage. We will right click this field to convert it to Discrete (Figure 27).\r\nFilter (Survey Response): LOOKUP(ATTR([Survey Responses]), 0)\r\n\r\nFigure 27: Dot Plot Part 3Similar to the diverging stacked bar chart, Survey Question is placed under Filters, as well as Filter (Survey Response). We will right click to Show Filter and the filters will appear on the right of the worksheet. The filters are changed to Single Value (dropdown) and customised to not show “All” value, as it’s not useful to show all options together. The steps were described in Figure 19 earlier. The title of Filter (Survey Response) is edited to Survey Response by Country, as seen in Figure 28.\r\nFigure 28: Dot Plot Part 4Next, Measure Values is placed under Columns and only Lower Limit and Upper Limit are kept (Figure 29). They are formatted to show the Percentage in 0 decimal place (as explained in Figure 18).\r\nFigure 29: Dot Plot Part 5The data visualisation or chart for Percentage is changed to Circle and that of Measure Values is changed to Line. Measure Names is placed under Path under Measure Values. This is shown in Figure 30.\r\nFigure 30: Dot Plot Part 6Dual Axis is created and the axes are synchronised, as seen in Figure 31. The axis titled “Value”, which represents the upper and lower limit percentages, is hidden, as the percentage can be seen in the bottom axis as well. The field label for row (Country) is also hidden to save space and because they should be easily understood by readers (as explained in Figure 23).\r\nFigure 31: Dot Plot Part 7To bring the dots in front of the lines, we right click the Percentage Axis and clicked Move marks to front (Figure 32). As explained earlier in Figure 18, We will also standardise the axis labels for Percentage to 0 decimal place, with 0.1 tick interval.\r\nFigure 32: Dot Plot Part 8Number of Records is placed under Detail under Percentage to show the number of survey respondents. The Tooltip for Percentage and Measure Values are edited, as seen in Figure 33. The Title is edited, as seen in Figure 34, to indicate the Survey Response represented by the dot plot.\r\nFigure 33: Dot Plot Part 9Figure 34: Dot Plot Part 10The Color for Percentage and Measure Values are changed to black and light blue respectively. The worksheet is adjusted to Fit Height (as explained in Figure 22). Figure 35 shows the dot plot with error bars.\r\nFigure 35: Dot Plot with Error Bars (Final)Title / Lead-in Paragraph\r\nNext, we wish to have a title or lead-in paragraph to allow indicate the relevant survey question, overall survey response percentage and number of survey respondents.\r\nA new worksheet is created. Survey Response, Percentage and Total Count are placed under Detail (Figure 36).\r\nFigure 36: Title Part 1Survey Question and Filter (Survey Response) are placed under Filters. We will right click to Show Filter and the filters will appear on the right of the worksheet. The Survey Question and Filter (Survey Response) filters are changed to Single Value (dropdown) and customised to not show “All” value, as it’s not useful to show all options together. The steps were described in Figure 19 earlier. The title of Filter (Survey Response) is edited to Overall Survey Response, as explained in Figure 28.\r\nThe title is edited and Figure 37 shows the interactive title or lead-in paragraph that will be used for the dashboard.\r\nFigure 37: Title Part 2Bar Chart (Breakdown by Demographics)\r\nNext, we will create a bar chart that will break down the survey respondents by demographics e.g. Gender. This will allow readers to compare and understand the sentiments of survey respondents of different demographics.\r\nA parameter, Demographic, is created, as seen in Figure 38 and explained earlier in Figure 25. We will right click Show Parameter and readers will be able to select the demographic to show.\r\nFigure 38: Bar Chart Part 1We will also create the following calculated field (as explained in Figure 13):\r\nDemographic: IF [Parameters].[Demographic]=“Gender” THEN [Gender] ELSEIF [Parameters].[Demographic]=“Household Children” THEN [Household Children] ELSEIF [Parameters].[Demographic]=“Household Size” THEN [Household Size] ELSEIF [Parameters].[Demographic]=“Employment Status” THEN [Employment Status] END\r\n\r\nDemographic is placed under Rows, Percentage under Columns, Number of Records under Detail, Survey Question and Survey Response under Filters.\r\nWe will right click to Show Filter and the filters will appear on the right of the worksheet. The Survey Question and Filter (Survey Response) filters are changed to Single Value (dropdown). Here, only the Survey Question filter is customised to not show “All” value, as it’s not useful to show all options together. The steps were described in Figure 19 earlier. The title of Filter (Survey Response) is edited to Survey Response, as explained in Figure 28.\r\nAs explained earlier in Figure 18, We will standardise the axis labels for Percentage to 0 decimal place, with 0.1 tick interval.\r\nThe title is edited, as seen in Figure 39. The Tooltip is also edited, as seen in Figure 40.\r\nFigure 39: Bar Chart Part 2Figure 40: Bar Chart Part 3The field label for row (Demographic) is hidden to save space and because it’s indicated in the title. The step is explained in Figure 23.\r\nThe Color and Border of the bar chart are changed to make the chart more aesthetically pleasing and clearer. The worksheet is adjusted to Fit Height (as explained in Figure 22). Figure 41 shows the bar chart (breakdown by demographics).\r\nFigure 41: Bar Chart (Final)Interactive and Synchronised Filters\r\nTo ensure the applied filters are synchronised across worksheets so that it can be reflected in all relevant data visualisations on dashboard, we will first place all the relevant filters in one of the worksheets e.g. Dot Plot with Error Bars.\r\nThe following are placed under Filters. The filters are shown and the respective properties are applied. The steps were described in Figure 19 earlier.\r\nGender (Single Value Dropdown)\r\nHousehold Size, Household Children, Employment Status (Multiple Values Dropdown)\r\nAge (Continuous, Range of Values) (Figure 42)\r\n\r\nFigure 42: Filters Part 1To apply the filters across worksheets, we right click each of the relevant filters (Survey Question, Gender, Age, Household Size, Household Children, Employment Status) and apply it to all using related data sources (Figure 43).\r\nFigure 43: Filters Part 2Next, we wish to make the filter interactive i.e. when we click the country in the dot plot with error bars and diverging stacked bar chart, the bar chart (breakdown by demographics) will be filtered accordingly in the dashboard. Figure 44 shows the steps to create this filter, which is under Actions, Add Action, Filter. A filter action will be reflected under Filters, as seen in Figure 45.\r\nFigure 44: Filters Part 3Figure 45: Filters Part 4Dashboard\r\nFinally, the dashboard is created. First, the size is changed to Automatic, as seen in Figure 46.\r\nFigure 46: Dashboard Part 1The 4 worksheets (Title, Dot Plot with Error Bars, Diverging Stacked Bar Chart, Breakdown) are added to the dashboard. Relevant filters are kept in the dashboard and they are changed to Floating (Figure 47) to allow easy size adjustment.\r\nFigure 47: Dashboard Part 2The relevant test descriptions are added to the dashboard to direct readers on how to use the dashboard. The data source is labelled by adding a Text object (Figure 48 and 49).\r\nFigure 48: Dashboard Part 3Figure 49: Dashboard Part 4To allow readers to observe the changes when different filters are applied, the animation is switched on (Figure 50).\r\nFigure 50: Dashboard Part 5To allow the sorting of the dot plot and diverging stacked bar chart to be synchronised and allow better comparison of survey responses from each country, we go back to the dot plot to create two parameters (Sort By, Sort Order), as seen in Figure 51. Steps to create a parameter was earlier explained in Figure 25.\r\nFigure 51: Sorting Part 1We will also create the following calculated field (as explained in Figure 13):\r\nSort Field: CASE [Sort By] WHEN “Percentage” THEN [Percentage] * [Sort Order] WHEN “Alphabetical” THEN MIN(ASCII([Country])) * [Sort Order] END\r\n\r\nSort Field is then applied to sort Country in both the dot plot and diverging stacked bar chart (Figure 52).\r\nFigure 52: Sorting Part 23.0 Proposed Data Visualisation Using Tableau\r\nFigure 53 shows the dashboard.\r\nFigure 53: DashboardMajor Observations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n1.0 Critiques and Improvements of Data Visualisation\r\nThe Report on Labour Force in Singapore (https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-In-Singapore-2019.aspx) is a key annual report on Singapore’s labour market. Below is a critique of MOM’s data visualisation on the resident labour force and how it can be improved. The data is available at https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-Tables2019.aspx, Table 5, Resident Labour Force Participation Rate by Age and Sex, 2009 - 2019 (June), and Table 7, Resident Labour Force Aged Fifteen Years and Over by Age and Sex, 2009 - 2019 (June).\r\nFigure 1: MOM’s Data VisualisationClarity\r\nBy looking at the two lines (blue and grey) in the data visualisation, we can generally tell that the share of resident labour force aged 55 & over was higher in 2019 (blue line) than 2009 (grey line) and lower for residents aged 25 to 54, which were mentioned in the lead-in paragraph. However, a line chart should not be used, as data was aggregated at each age range and it would otherwise make readers imply that the share of resident labour force can be interpolated and calculated at each age.\r\nA scatter plot can be used instead, with each point showing the share of resident labour force at each age range.\r\n\r\nThe lead-in paragraph compared the 2009 and 2019 share of resident labour force aged 25 to 54 and 55 & over. However, it is hard for readers to tabulate and compare the total share of resident labour force for these age ranges, as the data values were mostly given in 5-year age range. Furthermore, having too many age ranges make comparison tedious as well as redundant when the data values are similar.\r\nFewer age ranges can be used (15 to 24, 25 to 54, 55 to 64 and 65 & over) for the scatter plot to improve readability and aid comparison. The share of resident labour force and labour force participation rate for these age ranges will be calculated using the available data.\r\n\r\nThe reference lines clearly showed that the median age of residents in the labour force was higher in 2019 than 2009. However, it gives a wrong impression that the share of resident labour force can be interpolated and calculated at each age.\r\nThe reference lines can be removed from the data visualisation to prevent confusion.\r\n\r\nThe lead-in paragraph talks about the labour force participation rate. However, we cannot tell from the data visualisation how the labour force participation rate in 2019 differs from 2009.\r\nThe labour force participation rate can be used as the size for each point on the scatter plot i.e. bigger point implies higher labour force participation rate at the age range.\r\n\r\nThe title of the data visualisation should not be “resident labour force by age”. It gives a false impression that we can interpolate and find the share of resident labour force at each age.\r\nThe title can be changed to “How did the Resident Labour Force (%) at each Age Range change from 2009 to 2019?” to correctly represent the data given and make it appealing to readers.\r\n\r\nAesthetics\r\nThe use of two contrasting colours (blue and grey) for the lines and table rows clearly showed the data values belonging to the two years.\r\nFor the improved data visualisation, we can similarly use two contrasting colours for the scatter plot and data values.\r\n\r\nThe multiple labelling of “June 2009” and “June 2019” is not necessary, given the use of colours to differentiate the years.\r\nThe multiple labels can be removed and a legend can be created to show the colours (for the scatter plot and data values) that represent each year.\r\n\r\nThe tick marks on the x-axis are wrongly placed, inappropriate and confusing, as age range should be a categorical rather than a continuous variable. It gives a wrong impression that we can interpolate and find the share of resident labour force at each age.\r\nThe tick marks on the x-axis are not necessary and can be removed.\r\n\r\nThe data source is properly and clearly labelled at the bottom of the data visualisation.\r\nSimilarly, we can label the data source clearly in the improved data visualisation.\r\n\r\nSketch of Proposed Design\r\nFigure 2: Sketch of DesignThe first key message to convey is the change in the share of resident labour force from 2009 to 2019. Each point in the scatter plot represents the share of resident labour force at each age range and they are properly labelled with the data values. Readers will not be confused that the values can be interpolated at each age.\r\nThe next level of details to show readers is the labour force participation rate in 2009 and 2019. It can be easily compared by either looking at the size of the points or referring to the values in the table.\r\nAll points and data values are clearly shown and coloured according to the year.\r\n2.0 Step-by-Step Description of Data Visualisation Preparation\r\nData Preparation\r\nThe available data values from 2009 to 2019 for Resident Labour Force (RLF) and Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) are analysed. There is no notable change or spike in values between 2009 and 2019. Hence, the proposed data visualisation will focus on 2009 and 2019 values.\r\nThe 2009 and 2019 values for four age ranges (15 to 24, 25 to 54, 55 to 64, 65 & over) are collated in Excel. Additional calculations are required to convert LFPR from thousands to percentage (%).\r\nThe data values are then imported onto Tableau. The columns are renamed to appropriately represent the data values i.e. Age Range, RLF2009, RLF2019, LFPR2009, LFPR2019.\r\nFigure 3: Collated Data Values on ExcelFigure 4: Imported Data ValuesScatter Plot\r\n“Age Range” is placed under Columns and “RLF2009” and “RLF2019” are placed under Rows.\r\nThe bar charts are converted into scatter plot by clicking on dual axis. The axes are also synchronised.\r\nFigure 5: Scatter Plot Part 1To allow comparison of the labour force participation rate, “LFPR2009” and “LFPR2019” are placed under Size. The size of the points will reflect the labour force participation rate i.e. larger dot will indicate higher labour force participation rate.\r\nAs there are overlaps of the points, the opacity is set at 50% to allow easier comparison between the data values in 2009 and 2019. To further facilitate comparison, the size of the points is increased and contrasting colours (grey and blue) are used for 2009 and 2019 points after placing “Measure Names” under Colour.\r\nFigure 6: Scatter Plot Part 2“RLF2009” and “RLF2019” are placed under Label to show the RLF data values for 2009 and 2019. The labels are properly aligned and coloured according to the year.\r\nA legend is created using Annotation to show the colours that represent each year and therefore, multiple labelling is not required. The headers and field label for columns are also hidden to simplify the chart for readers and the dimensions of the chart are adjusted.\r\nFigure 7: Scatter Plot (Final)Data Table on Labour Force Participation Rate\r\n“Age Range” is placed under Columns and “LFPR2009” and “LFPR2019” are placed under Rows. Text Table under Show Me is clicked to generate the data table for LFPR. The rows and columns are swapped.\r\n“Measure Names” is placed under Colour and the font colours are changed to match the year.\r\nThe headers and field label for columns are hidden to simplify the chart for readers and reduce redundancy.\r\nFigure 8: LFPR DataDashboard\r\nA dashboard is created. The title, lead-in paragraph and source are added as text. The scatter plot and LFPR data table are added. Blanks are added to adjust the dashboard dimensions.\r\n3.0 Proposed Data Visualisation Using Tableau\r\nFigure 9: Tableau DesignMajor Observations\r\nA higher percentage of older residents was in the labour force in 2019. The share of resident labour force aged 55 & over rose from 15.7% in 2009 to 24.6% in 2019.\r\nThis was contributed by the higher labour force participation rate for residents aged 55 to 64 (69.9% in 2019 vs 60.6% in 2009) and residents aged 65 & over (28.7% in 2019 vs 17.2% in 2009).\r\nAt the same time, the share of resident labour force aged 25 to 54 fell from 75.4% in 2019 to 67.4% in 2019. This was despite having a higher labour force participation rate in 2019 (88.3%) than 2009 (84.5%).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n1.0 Overview\r\nCorrelation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coefficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\r\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coefficients of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\r\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\r\nTo reveal the relationship between highdimensional variables pairwisely.\r\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrixes as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\r\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\r\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\r\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\r\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R. .\r\n2.0 Installing and Launching R Packages\r\nBefore you get started, you are required:\r\nto start a new R project, and\r\nto create a new R Markdown document.\r\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.\r\n\r\n\r\npackages = c('ggpubr', 'tidyverse')\r\n\r\nfor(p in packages){library\r\n  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){\r\n    install.packages(p)\r\n  }\r\n  library(p, character.only = T)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Importing and Preparing The Data Set\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\n\r\n\r\nwine <- read_csv(\"data/wine_quality.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code chunks used to create the data visualisation consists of two main parts. First, we will create the individual histograms using the code chunk below.\r\n\r\n\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `fixed acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nva <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `volatile acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `citric acid`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nrs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `residual sugar`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `chlorides`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nfSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `free sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ntSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `total sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ndensity <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\npH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nsulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nalcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, the ggarrange function of ggpur package is used to group these histograms together.\r\n\r\n\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, \r\n          ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
