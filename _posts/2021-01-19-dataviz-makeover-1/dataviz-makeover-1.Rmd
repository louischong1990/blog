# 1.0 Critiques and Improvements of Data Visualisation

The Report on Labour Force in Singapore (https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-In-Singapore-2019.aspx) is a key annual report on Singapore's labour market. Below is a critique of MOM's data visualisation on the resident labour force and how it can be improved. The data is available at https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-Tables2019.aspx, Table 5, Resident Labour Force Participation Rate by Age and Sex, 2009 - 2019 (June).

## Clarity

* By looking at the two lines in the data visualisation, we can clearly tell that the share of residents aged 55 & over in the labour force rose in 2019 as compared to 2009 and fell for residents aged 25 to 54. However, a line chart should not be used, as data was aggregated at each age range and we will imply that we can interpolate and find the value at each age.
  + A dot chart can be used instead, with each point showing the share of residents in the labour force at each age range.

* The reference lines cleared showed that the median age of residents in the labour force was higher in 2019 than 2009. However, it also gives a wrong impression that the value at each age can be interpolated and found. Furthermore, the median age cannot be calculated using the data used in this exercise.
  + The reference lines can be removed to avoid confusion.

* The lead-in paragraph talks about the labour force participation rate. However, we cannot tell from the data visualisation how the labour force participation rate in 2019 differs from 2009.
  + The labour force participation rate can be used as the size for each point on the dot chart i.e. bigger point implies higher labour force participation rate at the age range. We can also include the data values under tooltip.

* The title of the data visualisation should not be "resident labour force by age". It will also give the false impression that we can interpolate and find the value at each age.
  + The title can be changed to "Resident Labour Force (%) and Labour Force Participation Rate (%) by Age Range" to illustrate the data given.

## Aesthetics

* The use of two contrasting colours (blue and grey) for the lines and table rows clearly showed the data belonging to the two years.
  + For the improved data visualisation, we can similarly use two contrasting colours for the dot chart and data.

* The multiple labelling of "June 2009" and "June 2019" is not necessary, given the use of colours to differentiate the years.
  + The multiple labels can be removed and a legend can be created to show the colours (for the dot chart and data) that represent each year.

* The tick marks on the x-axis are wrongly placed, inappropriate and confusing, as age range should be a categorical rather than a continuous variable. This makes it difficult to find the value at each age range on the line chart and gives the wrong impression that we can interpolate and find the value at each age.
  + The tick marks on the x-axis can be removed.

* The data source is properly and clearly labelled at the bottom of the data visualisation.
  + Similarly, we can label the data source clearly in the improved data visualisation.

## Sketch of Proposed Design

![Figure 2: Sketch of Design](/Distill/blog/Makeover1/Sketch1.jpg)

* The dot chart can show the share of residents in the labour force at each age range without confusing readers that the values can be interpolated at each age.
* The labour force participation rate can be easily compared by looking at the size of the dots for the two years.
* For each dot (or data point), the exact values of the share of resident labour force and labour force participation rate can be found under tooltip.


# 2.0 Step-by-Step Description of Data Visualisation Preparation

* Data Preparation
  + The relevant data values i.e. Share of Resident Labour Force (RLF) and Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) at all age ranges in 2009 and 2019 are collated in Excel and imported onto Tableau.
  ![Figure 3: Collated Data Values on Excel](/Distill/blog/Makeover1/Picture1.png)
  ![Figure 4: Imported Data Values](/Distill/blog/Makeover1/Picture2.png)
  + Each column is renamed to appropriately represent the data values i.e. Age Range, RLF 2009, RLF 2019, LFPR 2009, LFPR 2019.
  ![Figure 5: Imported Data Values with Renamed Columns](/Distill/blog/Makeover1/Picture3.png)

* Dot Chart
  + "Age Range" is placed under Columns and "RLF 2009" and "RLF 2019" are placed under Rows.
  ![Figure 6: Dot Chart Part 1](/Distill/blog/Makeover1/Picture4.png)
  + The bar charts are converted into dot chart by clicking on dual axis. The axes are also synchronised.
  ![Figure 7: Dot Chart Part 2](/Distill/blog/Makeover1/Picture5.png)
  + As the x-axis (Age Range) is vertically oriented, it's not easily readable. Thus, the axis is rotated and the chart is set to fit the width.
  ![Figure 8: Dot Chart Part 3](/Distill/blog/Makeover1/Picture6.png)
  + To allow comparison of the labour force participation rate, "LFPR 2009" and "LFPR 2019" are placed under Size. The size of the dots will reflect the labour force participation rate i.e. larger dot will indicate higher labour force participation rate.
  ![Figure 9: Dot Chart Part 4](/Distill/blog/Makeover1/Picture7.png)
  + As there are overlaps of the dots, the opacity is set at 50% to allow easier comparison between the data values in 2009 and 2019.
  ![Figure 10: Dot Chart Part 5](/Distill/blog/Makeover1/Picture8.png)
  + To further facilitate comparison of labour force participation rate between 2009 and 2019, the size of the dots is increased.
  ![Figure 11: Dot Chart Part 6](/Distill/blog/Makeover1/Picture9.png)
  + Age Range, RLF, LFPR and the relevant period are added to Tooltip to let readers find the exact data values at each dot if required.
  ![Figure 12: Dot Chart Part 7](/Distill/blog/Makeover1/Picture10.png)
  + A legend is created to show the colours that represent each year and therefore, multiple labelling is not required. The headers are also hidden to simplify the chart for readers.
  ![Figure 13: Dot Chart (Final)](/Distill/blog/Makeover1/Picture11.png)

* Data on Share of Resident Labour Force
  + "Age Range" is placed under Columns and "RLF 2009" and "RLF 2019" are placed under Rows. "Show Me" is clicked to generate the data table for share of resident labour force. "Measure Names" is placed under Color to change the font color to match the year.
  ![Figure 14: RLF Data](/Distill/blog/Makeover1/Picture12.png)

* Dashboard
  + A dashboard is created. The title, lead-in paragraph and source are added as text. The dot chart and RLF data are added.


# 3.0 Proposed Data Visualisation Using Tableau

![Figure 15: Tableau Design](/Distill/blog/Makeover1/Tableau1.png)

## Major Observations

* The share of resident labour force aged 55 & over rose from 15.6% in 2009 to 24.7% in 2019, with notable rise from 4.60% in 2009 to 7.30% in 2019 for residents aged 60 to 64 and from 1.80% in 2009 to 4.50% in 2019 for residents aged 65 to 69.
* This was partly due to the higher labour force participation rate for residents aged 55 & over, most notably 63.90% in 2019 vs 50.60% in 2009 for residents aged 60 to 64, and 46.10% in 2019 vs 29.90% in 2009 for residents aged 65 to 69.
* The labour force participation rate was generally higher in 2019 than 2009 for all age ranges except 20 to 24, which was 61.00% in 2019 vs 63.50% in 2009. Despite this, the overall share of resident labour force aged 25 to 54 declined from 75.3% to 67.5%.
